# Sales_report_project
My goal in this project was to practice and deepen my skills in database management and report writing in the business sector, using SQL and Power BI.

# Goals of the project:
My goal in this project was to practice and deepen my skills in database management and report writing in the business sector, using SQL and Power BI.
To this purpose, I used the AdventureWorks database* to process and interpret the data in the database to answer questions such as:

•	What are the best products?

•	Who are the biggest customers?

•	What categories of products generate the most revenue?

•	Which country buys which category of product more?

•	Which countries have the most customers and which are the biggest buyers?


*The AdventureWorks Database is a Microsoft product sample for an online transaction processing (OLTP) database. The AdventureWorks Database supports a fictitious, multinational manufacturing company called Adventure Works Cycles.

# Used programs:
•	Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio

•	Microsoft Power BI

# Skills developed by the project:

•	Data cleaning and transformation in SQL

•	Writing queries in SQL

•	Organize and prepare tables in Power BI

•	Visualize data and create dashboards in Power BI


# Steps of the project:

1.	Data cleaning and processing using SQL

As a first step, I used SQL to extract four different nested data tables that contained the necessary data for the analysis. 
Three data tables contained information on products, consumers, and sales, complemented by a table with the corresponding time stamps. The data tables were saved in Excel format.

2.	Data table organization

In the next step, using Power BI, I linked the data tables using the appropriate primary keys, and created the additional variables needed for analysis.

3.	Report preparation

Finally, using the transformed and cleaned data, I created reports using Power Bi to find deeper insights and answers to the initial questions.
